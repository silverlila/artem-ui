# Get started

The Artem-UI Design System was created to help us build products for our
customers more efficiently. Established to be the single source of truth for
product teams working on products across the globe, the Artem-UI Design
System contains everything from Getting Started guides through to Core
Components intended for adoption within each product. It enables product
teams to design and develop with speed, consistency, and quality.

## Install

ARTEM-UI components are written in React, and its stories are written in [Component Story Format](https://medium.com/storybookjs/component-story-format-66f4c32366df). It requires Storybook version 5.2-beta and up.

Add artem-ui to your project.

`npm install --save artem-ui`

### **Use**

Import components you want into your UI

`import { Button } from 'artem-ui'`

and use them like so

```
  const example = () => (
    <div>
      <Button variant="solid" onClick={() => 0}>Do something</Button>
    </div>
  )
```

### **Run and develop ARTEM-UI locally**

Clone the [Artem-UI GitHub project](https://github.com/silvi97lila/artem-ui) then start Storybook.

`yarn && yarn run storybook`

Note: this package is not used in Storybook's UI, but the visual design is identical.
